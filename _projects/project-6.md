This is the project for the fourth course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency.

The project is a traffic simulation in which vehicles are moving along streets and are crossing intersections. However, with increasing traffic in the city, traffic lights are needed for road safety. Each intersection will therefore be equipped with a traffic light. Entire project is implemented with a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections. Concurrent programming principles (such as mutexes, locks and message queues) along with Modern C++ features are used to implement the traffic lights and integrate them properly in the code base.
