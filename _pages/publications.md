During my final year of undergraduate study at Yangon Technological University, Myanmar, I did internship and conducted research as an intern in Robotics and Automation Research Lab (ROAR) at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I have collaborated with many people and published research articles, focusing on topics related to robotics, path planning and computer vision. You can find my list of publications below. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
